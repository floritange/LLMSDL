## D2 Classification Details

### Annotation Guidelines

1. Read the complete issue description including title, body, error messages, stack traces, and any related PR/commit information to understand the full context.

2. Identify the root cause of the defect (prompt handling, data processing, system integration, etc.).

3. Match to specific categories using the classification table

4. If an issue involves both LLM and traditional components, classify based on the primary failure point.

Classification table:
- LLM-Specific Defect Categories: 
   - LC1 (Prompt/query construction): Issues with prompt clarity, restrictions, or knowledge retrieval
   - LC2 (Interface and format processing): Problems with LLM input/output format validation, compatibility, or content limits
   - LC3 (Knowledge and context management): Knowledge misalignment, embedding issues, or history management problems
   - LC4 (LLM integration and management): Missing outputs, interactivity issues, error handling, privacy, or resource management
- Traditional Software Defect Categories:
   - TC1 (Implementation and logic): Logic errors, algorithm issues, API misuse, path handling, data type mismatches
   - TC2 (Resource and performance): Memory leaks, buffer overflow, resource exhaustion, performance bottlenecks
   - TC3 (Data handling): Input validation errors, data corruption, null pointer exceptions, configuration errors
   - TC4 (Concurrency): Race conditions, deadlocks, synchronization issues
   - TC5 (System integration): Security vulnerabilities, error handling deficiencies, compatibility issues, deployment failures

### Validation Procedures

1. Independent annotation (three annotators)

2. Cross-validation comparison

3. Fourth researcher arbitration (When consensus cannot be reached among the three annotators)

4. Inter-annotator agreement calculation(Fleiss's kappa)
